```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
```

the Adelie penguin has the shortest beak length by far, the chinstrap has the longestet beak lenth but there is significant overlap with the gentoo pengiun.


```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm)) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean(bill_length_mm), median(bill_length_mm), sd(bill_length_mm), skewness(bill_length_mm))
```

the gentoo penguin has data moderatly skewwed to the right, the other two penguines have more ballenced data. 
the standered deviations show that the data between penguins is simmilarly distributed.

```{r}
Gentoo <-  penguins %>%
   filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm), species == "Gentoo")
Adelie <-  penguins %>%
   filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm), species == "Adelie")
  
px = t.test(Gentoo$bill_length_mm, Adelie$bill_length_mm)
px

ggttest(px)
```

```{r}
library(infer)

null_dist <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == c("Gentoo", "Adelie")) %>%
  specify(bill_length_mm ~ species) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Gentoo", "Adelie"))

observed_stat <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == c("Gentoo", "Adelie")) %>%
  specify(bill_length_mm ~ species) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Gentoo", "Adelie"))

observed_stat

p_value <- null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "both")

p_value

null_dist %>%
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "both")

```


H_0 null hipothasis, there is no significant difference between the bill lengths of the Gentoo and the Adelie penguins

H_1 alternative hipothosis, there is a significant difference between the lengths of the bills of the Gentoo and adelie penguin

P value is less than 0.05 and thus we reject the null hypothesis.
null hipotheosis is there is no significant difference between the penguins,
the alternative apotheosis is that there is a significant difference between the bill lengths of the adelle and Gentoo penguins
the T value is greater than 2 so we can infer there is a significant difference between the data.

in the second test, permutation was used to create a simulated null distribution with 1000 reps.
this is a process of re-randomization and resampaling different possible combinations of observed data.
the p value was calculated to be zero which is likely due to lack of resolution in the infer packages ability.
it is in line with the original tests statistic of p-value < 2.2e-16.
from this we can reject H_0 and have found enough evidence to suggest that that the bill lenth between the Gentoo and Adslie penguins is significantly different.

below is a correlation matrix of several variables associated with the penguins.
in this pearson correlation we can see that flipper lenth and body mass are strongly correlated positively
this makes sense as a heavier penguin may require more propulsion in the water thus requiring larger flippers.
bill lenth also has a notable positive correlation with flipper lenth and body mass.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm) %>%
GGally::ggcorr(label = TRUE, method = c("pairwise", "pearson"))
```
