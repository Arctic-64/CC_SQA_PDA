PDA penguins task report

basic analysis

the data in the penguins dataset contained 3 species with a set of measurments
the bill depth, bill lenths, body weight and flipper lenth.

the analysis was centered around exploring the bill lenths of each species of penguin in relation to one another

i generated a series of visulaisations for this investigation

i had thought that bill lenths would vary between species an the result of my first visualisation seemed to support this idea.

i then calculated summary statistics for all species to check for any anomolous data points or biases in the data

following this i tested my hipothasis that the bill lenths between species where significantly different
i selected two species, the gentoo and the adelie.

i generated a null distrabution via permutation and procured a P-vlaue far below 0.05

this allowed me to reject the null hipothasis that there was no significant differance between the means
this was replaced with the alternative hipothasis which is the idea there is a significant diference between the bill lenths of the selected penguins.

a corrolation matrix was then generated to investigate other variables.
in this test, a strong positive relationship was discovered between the weight of a penguin and the flipper size.
