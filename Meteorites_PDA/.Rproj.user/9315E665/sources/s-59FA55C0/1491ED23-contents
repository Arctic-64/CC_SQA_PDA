```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
meteor <-  read_csv(here("clean_data/landings_CLEAN_additional_class_data.csv"))
meteor
```
```{r}
meteor %>%
  group_by(fall) %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = year, colour = fall) +
  geom_density()
```
the plot above shows the discovery of falling meteorites was more frequent in the past most likely due to the visibility in the sky allowing for easier recording
however near the year 2000, massive interest may have led to a boom in the dicvoery and excavation of meteorites for research.
haveing gained substantial knowlage from this, the number of found metorites will decrease due to already being found or lack of previous levels of reserch interest.
