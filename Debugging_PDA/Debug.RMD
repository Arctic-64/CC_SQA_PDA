library(here)
energy_scotland <- read_csv(here("data/energy_scotland.csv"))

# Task 1

Goal: return the row in the data which has the maximum energy production, making sure the code would work if new data was added to the dataset. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
max(energy_scotland$energy_prod)
# this returns value 25165.9 

energy_scotland %>%
  filter(energy_prod == 25165.9)
```

solution:
the code above only functions for that paricular dataset.
it will not account for a larger maximum being added to the data
this new code fixed that problem by filtering by the maximum number as opposed to a fixed constant

```{r}
energy_scotland %>%
  filter(energy_prod == max(energy_scotland$energy_prod))
```

# Task 2

Goal: create a new column called 'rating' to the energy table which will take the following values in the table. The bins should be inclusive of the upper value e.g. is the energy production is 20,000 exactly then will be 'high', if it's 10,000 exactly then will be 'medium', etc. 

| lower energy production | upper energy production | rating    |   
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 20000                   |                         | very high |   
| 10000                   | 20000                   | high      |  
| 5000                    | 10000                   | medium    |  
| 2000                    | 5000                    | low       |   
|                         | 2000                    | very low  | 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rating <- if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 20000, "very high", if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 10000 & energy_scotland$energy_prod <= 20000, "high", if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 5000 & energy_scotland$energy_prod <= 10000, "medium", if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 2000 & energy_scotland$energy_prod <= 5000, "low", "very low"))))

energy_scotland_rating <- bind_cols(energy_scotland, rating = rating)

energy_scotland_rating
```

solution:
code has been made more readable and the boundaries include the lower group and redundant code for repetitive operations has been removed.

```{r}
rating <- if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 20000, "very high", 
                  if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 10000, "high",
                  if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 5000, "medium",
                  if_else(energy_scotland$energy_prod > 2000, "low", 
                  "very low"))))

energy_scotland_rating <- bind_cols(energy_scotland, rating = rating)

energy_scotland_rating
```


# Task 3

Goal: create a plot which shows how the energy production for the sectors renewables, gas and pumped hydro compare over time.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
renewable <- energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == "Renewables")

gas <- energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == "Gas")

hydro <- energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == "Pumped hydro")

years <- unique(energy_scotland$year)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = energy_prod,  color = sector), data = renewable) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = energy_prod, color = sector), data = gas) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = energy_prod, color = sector), data = hydro) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +
  labs(title = "Energy production in Scotland over time split by sector", x ="Year", y = "Energy production")
```

solution:
condense the code for easier readability and make it more efficient by using a pipeline and note using extra redundant variables.

```{r}
years <- unique(energy_scotland$year)

energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector %in% c("Renewables", "Gas", "Pumped hydro")) %>%

ggplot(aes(x = year, y = energy_prod,  color = sector)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +
  labs(title = "Energy production in Scotland over time split by sector", x ="Year", y = "Energy production")
```

# Task 4

Goal: calculate the average energy production for the Coal, Gas, and Oil sectors across the time period in the data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector == c("Coal", "Gas", "Oil")) %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(avg_energy_prod = mean(energy_prod))
```

solution:
change == to %in% which includes all rows.

```{r}
energy_scotland %>%
  filter(sector %in% c("Coal", "Gas", "Oil")) %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(avg_energy_prod = mean(energy_prod))
```

# Task 5 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
student <- tibble(
  Name = c("Brian", "David", "Karen"),
  age = c(25, 56, 40),
  location = c("Scotland", "England", "scotland"),
  `email address` = c("briang@yahoo.co.uk", "dsmith@gmail.co.uk", "karen")
)

student
```
Goal: clean up this tibble by only returning the name, location and email address information, putting the location information into lowercase and also creating a new column called `valid_email` to have values `TRUE` or `FALSE` whether the email address is valid. Here our definition is valid is that it contains an `@` symbol followed by a combination of lowercase characters or a `.` symbol.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
student %>%
  select(name, location, email_address) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  str_to_lower(location) 
  mutate(valid_email = str_detect(email_address, "@a-z.")
```

solution:
move janitor to the top of the pipeline to have consistent columb names throghout.
add mutate to string to lower to allow easy overwrite.
include a-z. inside [] to allow for apporprite scan functionality

```{r}
student %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(name, location, email_address) %>%
  mutate(location = str_to_lower(location)) %>%
  mutate(valid_email = str_detect(email_address, "@[a-z.]"))
```

# Task 6

Goal: create a function to work on the all_salaries dataframe (or a similar dataframe that has a column `salary` and `job_area`). The function should take in the dataframe (`dataframe_input`) and a job area (`job_area_input`) and a salary value (`salary_input`). The function should only return the employees in the dataframe that have a salary above this value `salary_input` and who work in job area `job_area_input`. For example if `job_area_input` was 'Legal' and `salary_input` was 30000 then the function would return the following output:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
subsetting_salaries <- function(dataframe_input,job_area_input,salary_input){ 
  data <- dataframe_input %>% select(job_area) %>% filter(job_area == job_area_input)
  data1 <- data[data$savings > salary_input, ]
}

subsetting_salaries(CodeClanData::all_salaries, Human Resources, 30000)
```

solution:
remove CodeClanData because the datas already loaded, remove unnecessary select function, which erases critical data.
swap base R filter for a tidyverse filter function compatible with a pipe.
remove all redundant variables in favour of a pipeline.
return output.

```{r}
subsetting_salaries <- function(dataframe_input,job_area_input,salary_input){ 
  dataframe_input %>% 
  filter(job_area == job_area_input) %>%
  filter(savings > salary_input) %>%
  return()
}

subsetting_salaries(all_salaries, "Human Resources", 30000)
```
